# Physical memory
## About
M/UX handles memory in 4KiB pages (4096 bytes). When setting up a region, the physical memory manager (`physmem.c` & `physmem.h`) will calculate the size in pages, and create a subregion called the status region. The status region's size in bits is determined by the max amount of pages that the region can store. When the bit is set to `1`, the page is allocated, and when set to `0`, the page's memory is free.
Whenever the physical memory manager needs to find a free page, it will just loop for all bits in the status subregion of all regions, until it finds a `0`. Once it finds the zero, it calculates the actual address from the position of the zero in the status subregion.
After doing some research, M/UX's physical memory manager is apparently considered a [bitmap allocator](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/bitmap_allocator.html). The difference however, is that a `0` represents a free page and a `1` represents an allocated page.
